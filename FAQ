1.  It isn't working.  What's wrong?

flasher was designed to indicate file activity via the console LEDs.
Try switching to the console (Ctrl-Alt-F1 in FreeBSD and Linux) to see
if the LEDs are flashing there.

If you are using flasher in an X11 environment, see the manual page for
more information on how to get it to work.
